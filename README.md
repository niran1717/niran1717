Hi, I'm Niranjan Paramasivan 👋
☁️🤖 Aspiring AI Engineer & Cloud Solutions Builder

I’m an Autonomy Engineering graduate student at Purdue University with a clear vision:
to build intelligent systems that scale.

Where others see code and cloud as separate worlds, I see a synergy. I’ve used large language models to steer decision-making in autonomous vehicles, fine-tuned on 200K+ real-world scenarios. But what hooked me wasn’t just the AI; it was the infrastructure behind the intelligence. That fascination drew me deeper into AWS, where I now build scalable, resilient solutions that can deliver ML insights in real time.

Outside the console and code editor, I find balance in the gym, creative flow in sketching, and focus on the pickleball court.

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can bring together ML intuition, cloud engineering skills, and relentless curiosity to solve hard problems with impact.

**Skills:**  
- Python  
- Large Language Models  
- AWS  
- PyTorch
